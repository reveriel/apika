A tool for reverse engineering Android apk files.

Freatures:
\begin{itemize}
\item Disassembling resources to nearly original form (including resources.arsc,
  classes.dex, 9.png. and XMLs)
\item Rebuilding decoded resources back to binary APK/JAR
\item Organizing and handling APKs that depend on framework resources
\item Smali Debugging (Removed in 2.1.0 in favor of IdeaSmali)
\item Helping with repetitive tasks
\end{itemize}

\subsection{smali/baksmali}

smali/baksmali is an assembler/disassembler for the dex format used by dalvik,
Android's Java VM implementation. The syntax is loosely based on
Jasmin's/dedexer's syntax, and supports the full functionality of the dex format
(annotations, debug info, line info, etc.)
